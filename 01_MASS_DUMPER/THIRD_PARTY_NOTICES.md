# Third-Party Notices (Python and Third-Party Libraries)

This repository may depend on or interact with third-party software components,
including the Python programming language and additional third-party libraries.

All third-party software remains the property of its respective authors and is provided
under its own license terms. Use of those components is governed solely by their
respective licenses.

The owner of this repository (Francisco José Martínez Puchades) does not grant any
rights to third-party components beyond those granted by their authors, and does not
relicense third-party code.

You are responsible for:
- Identifying all third-party dependencies used in your environment.
- Reviewing, accepting, and complying with the licenses of those dependencies.
- Preserving required notices, attributions, and license texts where applicable.

If a LICENSES/ folder or dependency lockfiles (for example, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml,
poetry.lock, Pipfile.lock) are present, they should be treated as references for dependency
identification, but you must still verify the actual licenses of the installed packages.
